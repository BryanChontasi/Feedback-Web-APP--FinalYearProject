# Feedback-Web-APP--FinalYearProject
The main objective of this project was to create a web phone application, whereby in a lecture or presentation students can give feedback to the lecturer. This application has different types of voting criteria to use by the students. For example, if a lecture was interesting, students can vote privately without interrupting and the feedback is seen instantly by the teacher on Google Glass. I used HTML and CSS for the web design and Java and JavaScript languages to design main functions. I used Raspberry Pi as a server, including MySQL as database and a router is connected to the Raspberry pi to create a local network.
